# Introduction: Grace Hopper (maybe) and the "First actual case of bug being found"

<!-- But first, I want to talk a little about the history of software bugs as we know them. I‚Äôm going to start with Grace Hopper‚Äôs moth. Maybe you‚Äôve seen this image of a Harvards logbook. If you can‚Äôt read it, the text says ‚ÄúFirst actual case of bug being found,‚Äù which of course refers to this moth, which was found inside the Mark II.

<!--
This is a bank of relays on the Mark II, where the moth was found. It was finished in 1947 was an early electro-mechanical computers. It was built at Harvard and funded by the U.S. Navy to calculate ballistics. Most of the early computers were for war and astronomy. And making fabrics.

But anyway, the relays. The relays are mechanical components that could be opened and closed sequentially to execute programs. And on the day in question, September 9, 1947, a moth got jammed between points at Relay # 70, Panel F, and jammed the relay.

## "A developer put an image of Bart Simpson into the product as a placeholder. We forgot to replace it with the actual image that it was supposed to be, and shipped the product. Fox was not happy and 'politely' asked us to not do that and to give them some money, which we did."

# Some Fun I Had Along the Way

Fun with loops!

```ts {all|16|18-20}
import { getRandomWordFromArray } from "./string";

const phraseBank: string[] = [
  `Actually, it's pronounced ciabatta`,
  `Actually, it's pronounced aioli`,
  `I have a lot of BLT NFTs. You should have bought in on the ground floor.`,
];

export const getAiResponse = (
  previousPhrase: string | undefined,
  phrases: string[] = phraseBank
): string => {
  if (phrases.length < 2) {
    return phrases[0];
  }
  let responsePhrase = getRandomWordFromArray(phrases);
  //regenerate phrase if it matches the previous one
  while (responsePhrase === previousPhrase) {
    responsePhrase = getRandomWordFromArray(phrases);
  }
  return responsePhrase;
};
