# Introduction: The "First actual case of bug being found"

<img alt="Photograph of logbook page with moth taped to it" src="https://our-bugs-ourselves.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/moth.jpeg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 60%"/>

<p style="text-align: center; opacity: 75%;">RIP Moth (Photo: Smithsonian)</p>

<!-- But first, I want to talk a little about the history of software bugs as we know them. I‚Äôm going to start with the moth. Maybe you‚Äôve seen this image of a 1947 Harvard logbook. If you can‚Äôt read it, the text says ‚ÄúFirst actual case of bug being found,‚Äù which of course refers to this moth, which was found inside the Mark II.

<!--
This is a bank of relays on the Mark II, an early electro-mechanical computers. It was built at Harvard and funded by the U.S. Navy to calculate ballistics. Most of the early computers were for war. And also astronomy and making fabrics.

But anyway, the relays. The relays are mechanical components that could be opened and closed sequentially to execute programs. And on the day in question, September 9, 1947, a moth got between points at Relay # 70, Panel F, and jammed the relay.

<p style="text-align: center; opacity: 75%;">(Photo: Smithsonian)</p>

<!--
You may have heard the moth described as the first computer bug, or as the origin of term computer bug. And in a lot of sources, the moth in the logbook is attributed to pioneering computer scientist Grace Hopper. In reality, neither of those things are true. Hopper was certainly on the team that found the moth, but the logbook entry is not attributed to a specific person, and archivists have noted that the handwriting doesn't seem like a good match for Hopper's.

<p style="text-align: center; opacity: 75%;">(Photo: Smithsonian)</p>

<!--
Hopper did make these doodles of computer bugs she encountered. She was known to be a big jokester. It's a little hard to read, but I think the lower left one says "...he who seeds wrong data." Or maybe it's "wormy data." And I think the top right says "Kitchie boo boo bug. He who goes around loosening relays." And in the bottom right, "he who brings good data."

And when she made those cartoons (I'm not actually sure if they're from before or after the moth, I couldn't find a year for them), the term bug was already in the engineering lexicon.

## "It has been just so in all of my inventions. The first step is an intuition, and comes with a burst, then difficulties arise‚Äîthis thing gives out and [it is] then that 'Bugs'‚Äîas such little faults and difficulties are called‚Äîshow themselves and months of intense watching, study and labor are requisite before commercial success or failure is certainly reached."

<p style="margin-left: 50%">-Thomas Edison in a letter to Theodore Puskas, 1878</p>
</div>

<!--
 In fact, Thomas Edison is well known to have used the term "bug" to describe problems with electrical circuits. Here's a quote from a letter he wrote in 1878.

 And I just love this description of engineering, or honestly any kind of act of creativity and invention. Intuition in a burst, followed by difficulties.

## Bug comes from the Middle English word _bugge_, as in bugbear or bugaboo--monsters!

<img alt="Cartoon bugbear" src="https://our-bugs-ourselves.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bugbear_pony.jpeg" style="display: block; max-width: 80%; padding-left: 20px;"/>

<!--
And the word bug itself comes from the old english bugge, which did not refer to insects but rather bugbears or bugaboos, which were monsters. And here are some bugbears, including one from Baldur's gate and My Little Pony.

So the moth in the logbook was almost definitely documented with humorous intent, a real life bug causing a real life engineering problem.

And I love how it represents a lot of how we think and talk about bugs in software, whether they're insects or monsters, as these outside interlopers who come into our code and muck things up.

# Part 1: Bugs as Nuisances

# A class applied to the wrong element ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

```js {all|12|16|all}

export function VideoThumbnail({
  name,
  isMirrored,
  videoRef,
  videoTransmissionEnabled,
}) {
 return (
  <div
    className={twMerge(
      classNames("flex justify-center items-center rounded-2xl", {
        "scale-x-[-1]": isMirrored,
      })
    )}>
    {
      videoTransmissionEnabled ? <video ref={videoRef} /> : <p> {name} <p/>
    }
  </div>
 )
};
```

<!--
What happened here is that I needed to add a tailwind class to mirror the video thumbnail. But when the video is off, the thumbnail display's the user's name instead. Buttttt I applied the mirroring class to the div that wraps the video itself rather than the video, and I never tested what that would look like with the video off.

# The case of the 0 minute mile

<img alt="A screenshot that says 'Race Page: 0:00/mi'" src="https://our-bugs-ourselves.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pace.png" style="display: block; max-width: 40%; margin: 0 auto;  "/>

<!--
And here's on I saw as a user. This year I ran the Hood to Coast relay. When you register, you need to enter a pace from a previous race, which the organizers will use to figure out how fast your team is and hence, what your start time should be. But at some point, the entered values were converted from one system to another, and any values without a seconds input were converted to zeroes. Which means that multiple teammates were registered with a 0 minute mile. Now this is a fast, good-looking group of people, but none of them can run a 0 minute mile. So it was a pretty big headache for our team captain to get our start time adjusted.

# Y2K

* ## Approximately 500 residents in Philadelphia received jury duty summonses for dates in 1900

<p></p>

* ## In Denmark, the first baby born on January 1 was recorded as being 100 years old

<p></p>

* ## In New York, a video store accidentally generated a $91,250 late fee because the store computer determined a tape rental was 100 years overdue

<p style="opacity: 75%; margin-left: 30px;" >(Photo: eBay)</p>


<!--
Y2K is mainly remembered as the bug that wasn't. Well actually, I was ten at the turn of the new millennium, so what I remember is this bug plushy that my grandpa had. If you bonked it against something it made a crashing noise. Did anyone else have this? It's now worth like $8 on ebay I learned. But anyway. The use of two digit shorthand for years of course predates computers, but was standard in early computing due to ruthless bit conservation needs. As the year 2000 approached, there was widespread concern that computer systems would be unable to distinguish dates, causing major chaos.

So while there wasn't widespread crises, there is an amazing list you can find on Wikipedia of things that did go wrong. These are a few of my favorites. And who among hasn't battled

# Part 2: Bugs as Crises

</div>

<!--
Though of course, not all bugs live in the territory of minor bother or humorous historical footnote. While our jobs may not be as high stakes as surgeons or nuclear power engineers, what we build matters. The things we fail to account for, the unhandled edge cases, the mistakes that no one caught in review can have real consequences sometimes.

# Deadly race conditions

* ## In the mid-1980s, the Therac-25, a computer-controlled radiation therapy machine, was involved in at least 6 serious accidents (some of them fatal) when it gave patients radiation doses that were hundreds of times greater than expected

<p></p>

* ## The Northeast blackout of 2003, which resulted in approximately 100 deaths, was set into motion by a race condition in the alarm system at the control room of FirstEnergy, an Akron, Ohio

<!--
Race conditions are one of those classic, aggravating programming problems that we all encounter from time to time.

In the mid-1980s, the Therac-25, a computer-controlled radiation therapy machine, was involved in at least 6 serious accidents when it gave patients radiation doses that were hundreds of times greater than expected. And while the bug was the root cause of the catastrophic dosing error this case is often held up as example of how software processes, and software engineers, fail. The engineers responsible have been described as overconfident in their software, which was not adequately tested. They initially failed to believe user's claims of issues with the machines, or blamed it on operator error. Additionally, bad UI/UX, including cryptic error messages didn't to adequately signal to operators that something was terribly wrong.

A major blackout in 2003 was also caused by a race condition.

# The National Eating Disorders Association's Dangerous ChatBot

<p></p>

## "The recommendations that Tessa gave me was that I could lose 1 to 2 pounds per week, that I should eat no more than 2,000 calories in a day, that I should have a calorie deficit of 500-1,000 calories per day...All of which might sound benign to the general listener. However, to an individual with an eating disorder, the focus of weight loss really fuels the eating disorder."

<p></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40%">-Sharon Maxwell, eating disorder survivor and recovery consultant </p>

<!--
I also wanted to talk about a more recent case, from the mental health field. There was a scandal you may have heard about earlier this year, which involved a chatbot on the website of the National Eating Disorders Association website. For many years, NEDA had a phone and chat helpline that was run by both volunteers and paid staffers. Back in May, they switched to a fully automated chatbot.

Pretty soon, there were reports from users that the chatbot was providing responses that were wildly inappropriate for eating disorder survivors, like this one. Now there was a lot of finger pointing between NEDA and Cass, the company that built the chatbot. This was initially developed NOT to use a large language model, but as a strictly rule based program built entirely with pre-written messages. However, a newer version was released that leveraged AI alongside the phrase bank, which was probably how this happened.

This failure, like any serious software issue that makes it to production, has a lot of layers of course. There was the initial move to an automated solution in the first place. While NEDA disputes that this was the impetus for the move, it's worth noting that the helpline staffers had just formed a union. But there are layers of product, design, and engineering here too. Somebody built this, and released it without realizing it could be harmful. And as we think about the care we facilitate with our work here at Grow, it's crucial to think about the complexities and tradeoffs of automation.

Because of course, we all know that in reality bugs are really external insects or monsters. Usually, we create them. Which means we can prevent them, too.

<!--
So while it's so important to think about the very real stakes of our work, one of favorite ways, or at least aspirationally my favorite way, to think about bugs, is about opportunities to improve -- ourselves, our teams, our processes, and our systems

# Opportunity #1: Deepen our understanding

<!--
You know that feeling when a bug sends you down a weird and specific little rabbit hole? Like a small but confounding UI bug that leads you to closed GitHub issue from 2016 that teaches you that empty/null/undefined react children are still included in a count when mapped over?? And it's such a beautiful journey of discovery??

And once we've solved a bug, we like to step back and see how we could prevent a similar issue from occurring in the future.

When Jasmine presented to the FE guild at the onsite last month, I loved how she talked about "evaluative versus validation." Robust systems of logging, monitoring, and testing help us not just validate whether things are working as expected, but evaluate issues we hadn't even considered.

# Opportunity #3: Strengthen our relationships

<!--
Thorny problems in our code don't just unite use through critsit trauma bonding--tho that too! Just like the most spectacular failures must involve layers of error--lack or oversight, planning, testing, checking assumptions, the greatest successes and comebacks are also collective.

The most challenging problems usually require multiple minds, and expanding our perspective through pair programming, intensive reviews, and good questions, makes us all better.
