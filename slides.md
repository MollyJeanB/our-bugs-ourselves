## "A developer put an image of Bart Simpson into the product as a placeholder. We forgot to replace it with the actual image that it was supposed to be, and shipped the product. Fox was not happy and 'politely' asked us to not do that and to give them some money, which we did."

# Some Fun I Had Along the Way

Fun with loops!

```ts {all|16|18-20}
import { getRandomWordFromArray } from "./string";

const phraseBank: string[] = [
  `Actually, it's pronounced ciabatta`,
  `Actually, it's pronounced aioli`,
  `I have a lot of BLT NFTs. You should have bought in on the ground floor.`,
];

export const getAiResponse = (
  previousPhrase: string | undefined,
  phrases: string[] = phraseBank
): string => {
  if (phrases.length < 2) {
    return phrases[0];
  }
  let responsePhrase = getRandomWordFromArray(phrases);
  //regenerate phrase if it matches the previous one
  while (responsePhrase === previousPhrase) {
    responsePhrase = getRandomWordFromArray(phrases);
  }
  return responsePhrase;
};
```
